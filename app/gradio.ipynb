      "\n",
      "2. No ROS Master: In ROS 2, nodes can find each other without the need for a ROS Master, allowing new nodes to join the network at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Shared Implementation for C++ and Python: ROS 2 has a shared backend code base for both C++ and Python, ensuring consistent functionality across both languages.\n",
